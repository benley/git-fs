Map more stuff
  changeset trees, ie a tree showing the before/after of files touched by a changeset
  tags
    descriptions
    tagger
    signatures
  reflog
    messages
    date-based view
  bisect stuff
    BISECT_EXPECTED_REV BISECT_START BISECT_LOG BISECT_RUN BISECT_NAMES
  configuration
  remote urls
  optional symlinks, that only exist when their target does
    uses: various symbolic refs, the origin remote.

Get a library to access the repo without fork/malloc/die cycles
that cost (in memory latency? whatever, it's very slow).
Also consider getting rid of the file-at-once requirement;
things like libmagic need much less.

There are a ton of perf tweaks we could do, but they are dwarfed by
the library stuff so I won't mention them.

Use inotify for better performance or accuracy.
Symbolic refs are currently cached for too long.

== Done

git fs status: display if currently mounted.
Distinct from git fs is-mounted, which uses the exit status and is
meant to be machine-readable for prompts and the like.

Remove the base64 refnames hack.
Add a default mountpoint, and be singleton on that.
Simplest possible tag support.
Basic reflog support.
Support symlinks inside the worktree.

Get rid of system(); abstractions backed by shit and it's unsafe. Go the exec route, not the autoquote everything crap.
This was done at the cost of some deep integration with Unix / BatUnix, unfortunately.

Elucidate the stat st_size stuff; fuse sounds like it relies on it.
Using correct sizes. Fuse relies on it because it does caching, and will
make bigger read requests if necessary (-o max_readahead).

Figure out why it won't work in the background (ie, without fuse option -f).
To strace that, better to reattach that run strace in the foreground.
The problem was that fuse changed directory to / (following standard
daemon behaviour).

Nicer singleton behaviour; detect when already mounted.

Symbolic refs are mapped
  The list isn't discoverable.
  Must be uppercase/underscores directly below $GIT_DIR.
    HEAD, FETCH_HEAD, ORIG_HEAD, MERGE_HEAD, BISECT_EXPECTED_REV, BISECT_START
    git grep -wl --all-match -e HEAD -e FETCH_HEAD -e ORIG_HEAD -e MERGE_HEAD

Symbolic refs with their own reflog, both for normal symrefs
and detached symrefs.

Logs are mapped.

git fs mtab: display what is already mounted.
